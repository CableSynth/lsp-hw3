This directory provides some resources for developing your familiarity with
kernel modules and their development.  Most of the resources C code is from
Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love and/or Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Ed,
by Jonathan Corbet, Alessandro Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

The resources in this directory include:
  Hello-World-Modules:
    Two simple kernel modules with their makefiles.  NOTE:  root priviledges
    are required to compile and install these modules; therefore, it is
    most suitable that you copy these programs to your LFS machine for
    experimentation.

  Character-Devices:
    A directory containing the template code for HW4 in four sub-diretories
      1. Scull-Modified-For-HW4: a stripped-down version of the scull character
         driver from LDD chapter 3.
      2. PWD-Vault: code to implement the password vault data structure (i., the
         replacement data structure for the original scull qset and quantum.
      3. Test-Programs: programs provided to the students to help them test
         their implementation of HW4.
      4. Scull-Original:  the original (working) scull driver.  Students need
         NOT concern themselves with this code for HW4.  It is merely provided
         as a historical reference.

  Net-Filters:
    A directory containing the template code for HW5

  .:
    randGen:  a sript to demonstrate accessing a parameter of /dev/random
              via the /proc file system hierarchy.
