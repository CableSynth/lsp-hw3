The scull code in LDD3 is too old to run on modern linux kernels.  However the
authors have managed to keep the code updated on GitHub at:
  https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3.

The entire source repository was downloaded as a zip, unzipped it on john, then
the first of the scull examples (the one from Chapter 3) wa moded to the LFS
machine for modification.

To make the scull source more easiy understood for CS3320, the instructor 
removed references to debugging information and additional devices (e.g., 
scullpipe, sculla, etc.), thoroughly commented the code, and improved the 
formatting.

He also simpified the Makefile to be more like the one from the hello world 
example.

What now remains is a simplified version of scull which should be modified
to implement HW4.
