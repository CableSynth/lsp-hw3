  Character-Devices:
    A directory containing the template code for HW4 in four sub-diretories
      0. HW4-Files: the scripts for loading and unloading the character driver 
         build as part of HW4 and some starter code.
      1. Scull-Modified-For-HW4: a stripped-down version of the scull character
         driver from LDD chapter 3.
      2. PWD-Vault: code to implement the password vault data structure (i., the
         replacement data structure for the original scull qset and quantum.
      3. Test-Programs: programs provided to the students to help them test
         their implementation of HW4.
      4. Scull-Original:  the original (working) scull driver.  Students need
         NOT concern themselves with this code for HW4.  It is merely provided
         as a historical reference.
